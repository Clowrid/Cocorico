Cocorico
========
Writting Wordpress admin-pages made easy.

Cocorcio works with themes, plugins and meta-boxes (widgets & customizer are on the roadmap). All the most common input types are available out of the box (including file upload & color picker) and the styles are consistent with the wordpress admin interface.

Documentation [is available](https://github.com/y-lohse/Cocorico/wiki).

While Cocorico is **not** feature complete at this point, it's already used in production and works very steadily. Questions & PRs are welcome.
